dnsmasq -d -a 172.17.0.3

with no docker port redirects, we need to use other tools to pass the packets.

apt-get install isc-dhcp-relay
``dhcrelay -i br0 172.17.0.3 -d``

will pass the dhcp requests from the ethernet network to the docker container, but the container's replies are dumpted on the ground (you can see them on with ``dhcpdump -i docker0``)

the next day, I followed a slightly different tack:

root@mini:~# bcrelay -i docker0 -o br0
root@mini:~# dhcrelay 172.17.0.5 -m forward -D -d -i br0

and setup http://blog.codeaholics.org/2013/giving-dockerlxc-containers-a-routable-ip-address/

I now have to back each bit out to see what isn't needed :)
1. killed the bcrelay, it still works?
2. killed the dhcrelay, and it stopped working


interestingly, after running it for a while, the host box becomes unresponsive (and there are no dhcp server replies either
